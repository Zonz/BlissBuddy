# BlissBuddy
A small utility app for BlissScape, an RSPS.

Currently, BlissBuddy has 3 main features.

First is the Skills window. Here, you can select a skill, enter a current and target experience amount, select an experience method, and it will calculate how many iterations of that method are needed to reach the target experience. It also has the ability to look up a player's stats to fill in all current experience fields.

Second is the Equipment window. Here, you can create a mock-up of equipment as if it were equipped onto a player, so you can see the stats given by the equipment. You can save equipment loadouts to a txt file, and load them back later. Left click on a slot to change the equipment, and right click on a slot to clear it.

Third is the Lamp window. This is a simplified version of a skill window where you can enter a current and target experience, and it will calculate how many experience lamps are needed to reach the target experience. This takes into account current and target prestige, as well as intermittent prestiges, if present.
